[{"id":"256","title":"Thanking community partners for promoting literacy","byline":"Former Superintendent Pat Skorkowsky","description":"<p>\r\n\tThe APPLE (All People Promoting Literacy Efforts) Partnership was founded 12 years ago by the Clark County School District (CCSD), the City of Henderson and the Henderson Library District. The purpose was to increase the amount of time students were reading outside of school. In the second year, we included the Henderson Parks and Recreation Department to get our students reading in the SafeKey programs before and after school. One of the components of the initial partnership is the APPLE CORE (Counting Our Reading Efforts) Program.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUpon being named superintendent, I reached out to the City of Las Vegas and the City of North Las Vegas to extend an opportunity for new APPLE CORE Programs in the schools within their boundaries. This year, 114 elementary schools in the three cities participated in the program. Students kept track of the minutes and hours they read on evenings and weekends and turned in bookmarks to their schools.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis last week, our CCSD K-12 Library Services staff, along with our community partners, celebrated the APPLE CORE Program across the valley. I was fortunate enough to attend these events that highlighted not only the schools who were recognized as winners, but also individual students across the cities who either won a Kindle Fire or a collection of books for their own personal libraries.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the 12 years that the APPLE CORE Program has been existence in Henderson, the students in 24 schools have read a total of 4,320,496 hours or 259,229,760 minutes. The Atkins Company sponsored the monetary prizes. The following school results were celebrated:<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t1<sup>st<\/sup> place&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (David) Cox ES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 65.5 hours per student&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $7,000<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t2<sup>nd<\/sup> place&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smalley ES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64.7 hours per student&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $1,000<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t3<sup>rd<\/sup> place&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sewell ES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 59.4 hours per student&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $500<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the four years that the APPLE CORE Program has been existence in Las Vegas, the students in 69 schools have read a total of 1,038,706 hours or 62,322,360 minutes.

Reflecting upon the last five years, these are my personal favorites and in no way reflect any priority in CCSD. These programs either make me smile or cry happy tears, but all have made a significant impact on the students of CCSD.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n\tI was sitting in a local restaurant at lunch last week, trying to get a meal in between three school visits and three afternoon meetings. As I was talking with the individuals sitting at the table, the waiter brought over a note from another patron and stated, &ldquo;I was asked to give you this.&rdquo; As I sat and read the note over and over, tears were rolling down my face.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n\t<em>Click <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.ccsd.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/mission-high-note.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a> to view the note.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMission High School was a risk for the trustees and myself.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; <\/span>The questions were simple, &ldquo;Could we create the nation&rsquo;s first non-charter, non-private high school to serve students who were willing to take on their addictions? Could we create an environment where students were &lsquo;willing&rsquo; to participate in their personal recovery?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n\tThe overwhelming answer was YES!<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; <\/span>It took many meetings and many community partners to step up to assist with this amazing program. It took many individuals who were willing to give time, money and support to CCSD, as well as the principal and her team.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n\tMission High School is not a cure for addiction; there is no cure. It is a place where some of our most challenged students go to complete high school and to make the daily goal of &ldquo;one day at a time.&rdquo; We are so proud of the team that put this together, including Jeff Horn, a school associate superintendent, who was the CCSD champion.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n\tThis program didn&rsquo;t have to be created by CCSD.
