					  		<p>To guide instruction and improve performance for all students, schools must analyze and use multiple types of assessments on multiple occasions with the goal of increasing student achievement.  The Clark County School District Balanced Assessment System consists of assessments <em>for</em> learning (formative) and assessments <em>of</em> learning (summative).</p>

<p>Formative assessment is a deliberate process used by teachers and students during instruction. It provides actionable feedback that is used to adjust ongoing teaching and
learning strategies in order to improve students’ self-assessment, reflection, and deepen learning.</p>

<p>Summative assessments are often “standardized tests of learning” instruments and verify mastery of grade-level content standards. These assessments occur after instruction to gauge learning. The Smarter Balanced Assessments, also known as SBAC, are the Nevada system for assessing students in Grades 3–8 in Mathematics and English Language Arts. This summative assessment covers the full range of college and career-ready knowledge and skills represented in the Nevada Academic Content Standards and will be administered to students during the spring.</p>

<p>In addition, students in Grades 5, 8, and 9 will participate in the Criterion-Referenced Test (CRT) for Science, which is aligned to the Nevada Academic Content Standards for Science based on the Next Generation Science Standards. </p>
<p>The Nevada Alternate Assessment (NAA) is administered to identified students in lieu of the Smarter Balanced Assessments. Approximately one percent of students participate in the NAA. The NAA assesses the performance of alternative achievement standards through direct observation of specific tasks connected to the standards.
</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015, parents/guardians may request, at their child’s enrolled school, information regarding participating/not participating in the assessments, where applicable.
</p>
<p>For more information on the Smarter Balanced Assessment System and the Criterion-Referenced Tests administered in Nevada, please visit  <a href="https://smarterbalanced.org/" target="_blank">smarterbalanced.org</a> and <a href="https://aarsi.ccsd.net/assessment/" target="_blank">aarsi.ccsd.net/assessment/</a>.

 <p>To graduate from high school, students must complete both the required coursework and the testing requirements specific to their cohort year, regardless of what year they graduate.</p> 

<p>All students will be enrolled in the Core Enrollment Expectations outlined in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 389.018. These expectations serve as the foundation for all diploma types. They also align with the Nevada System of Higher Education Board of Regents’ Core Curriculum Requirements and support eligibility for the Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship.</p>

<p>In addition, students must take the College and Career Readiness Assessment during their junior year. This assessment is provided at no cost. For students with disabilities, the Individualized Education Program (IEP) team will determine appropriate assessments and any necessary accommodations. The IEP team may also decide if a student should be exempt from the College and Career Readiness Assessment.</p>

Students with specific health needs may require the cell phone to be in a non-blocking (Bluetooth-enabling) pouch near them to transmit a signal to medical devices. Examples include diabetic pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices. Students with medical exemptions should have their cell phone on their person in the event of an emergency or evacuation. Parents/Guardians should contact the school's health office for more information.

                The introduction of non-locking, signal-blocking pouches is not a punitive measure. The intent is to create a classroom environment in which students can learn free from distractions caused by the personal use of devices; to reduce the negative impacts for all students of inappropriate use of devices at school, such as cyberbullying, exposure to harmful content, and incidents involving mobile phones that detract from a healthy school climate; and to increase meaningful face-to-face connections between students.
