					  		<p>The Clark County School District (CCSD) is committed to fostering a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment that supports the well-being and academic success of every
student. We believe that by providing families with information and resources about discrimination based on race, bullying, and cyberbullying, we can better equip students
and adults to understand these issues, recognize their impact, and take proactive steps to prevent them.</p>

<p>
CCSD maintains a strong stance against all forms of discrimination, including those based on race, as well as bullying and cyberbullying. Our goal is to ensure that all
students and employees feel secure and valued in every school, classroom, and District-sponsored event.</p> 

<p>According to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 388.1235, “Discrimination based on race” refers to any single or repeated act—whether directed at a specific individual or a
demographic group—that targets a person's race, color, culture, religion, language, ethnicity, or national origin. Such acts can cause harm or contribute to a hostile learning or working environment. Examples include, but are not limited to, jokes, threats, physical confrontations, or intimidation. These actions may occur in person, online, or in
distance learning environments.</p>


<p>Under NRS 388.122, bullying includes any written, verbal, or electronic expression—or physical act or gesture—that targets an individual or group. It may also involve a single, severe, and willful act intended to cause harm. For the full definition, please refer to <a href="https://ccsd.net/district/policies-regulations/pdf/5137_P.pdf" target="_blank">CCSD Policy 5137</a>.</p>

<p>Students who are determined to be victims of substantiated bullying, cyberbullying, or racial discrimination may, at the request of their parent or guardian, be reassigned to another public school.</p>

<p>This policy does not limit the District’s authority to take disciplinary action against offenders in accordance with CCSD regulations.</p> 

<p>To report any incidents of discrimination based on race, bullying, or cyberbullying, please contact your school’s principal or administrator. You may also file a report
anonymously at <a href="http://safevoicenv.org/" target="_blank">safevoicenv.org</a>.</p>

 <p>SafeVoice is an anonymous reporting system available to students, parents/guardians, and school staff across Nevada. Created by the Nevada Department of Education and
established under Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS 388.1451 to 388.1459), SafeVoice was designed to promote student wellness, prevent violence, and ultimately save lives.</p>


<p>In collaboration with the Nevada Department of Public Safety, SafeVoice offers a safe and confidential way for students to share concerns about their own safety or the safety
of others. Reports are handled 24/7/365 by a team of trained professionals who respond promptly and appropriately to every tip. All reports remain completely anonymous.</p>

               <p>To support the Clark County School District’s one-to-one device initiatives and deployments, distance and blended learning, mental health support initiatives, and to
comply with the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) E-rate program rules, the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), and the Protecting Children in the 21st Century
Act, CCSD requires a content filtering, management, theft recovery, alerting, and remote teaching/proctoring solution. CCSD will continue the usage of GoGuardian districtwide for the 2025-2026 school year.</p>

<p>GoGuardian is deployed to the students' nv.ccsd.net user accounts as an extension, and the application functionality will be only enabled when a student is logged into a
Chromebook or Chrome browser on any operating system (Mac/PC) with their nv.ccsd.net user account, regardless of whether the device was issued by CCSD or is a personal device.</p>

<p>The GoGuardian Suite is utilized for content filtering and blocking access to harmful or inappropriate websites. GoGuardian also provides class management tools for teachers
to help keep students on task and away from distracting content during instructional time. In addition, GoGuardian Beacon 24/7 provides alerts to CCSD staff 24 hours a day, monitoring online activity that is considered a life-safety issue or threat, such as actively planning suicide or self-harm. More information for parents/guardians can be found in
the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ov_jFoiYtw3c46BALBOLFZouT6mJ03GeON1G2qR5l70/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.jmid5nea5psa" target="_blank">GoGuardian Parent Information document</a>.</p>

<p>Though GoGuardian may provide protection against inappropriate content for students, monitor online activities, and alert for life-safety issues, no filtering or monitoring
system is perfect. CCSD cannot and does not represent that inappropriate or objectionable material can be completely filtered and does not guarantee that all life-safety issues will be detected. Parents/Guardians are still responsible for actively monitoring their child(ren).</p>

<p>Additional information on the GoGuardian Suite can be found on <a href="https://stutech.ccsd.net/goguardian/" target="_blank">stutech.ccsd.net</a>.</p>

<p>Parents/Guardians should frequently review the content, including apps, media files, etc., of students’ mobile devices to ensure that they are being used appropriately. If
parents/guardians are concerned or have questions regarding the use of the devices, they may contact school staff for clarification.</p>

	      <li><strong>Know the Route:</strong> Parents/Guardians should know with whom their child is walking or bicycling and what their normal route to and from school is.</li> 

<li><strong>Avoid Shortcuts:</strong> Remind children not to take shortcuts through isolated areas or play
alone in deserted areas.</li> 

<li><strong>Accompany When Needed:</strong> Parents/Guardians should walk or ride with their younger
children and occasionally accompany older children to school, and/or monitor the route.</li> 

<li><strong>Stay Alert at Crossings:</strong> Watch for cars at driveways and intersections. Look out for
drivers in parked vehicles who may be pulling out onto the street.</li> 

<li><strong>Cross Safely:</strong> Always use marked crosswalks or intersections. Stop, look left-right-left,
and stay alert while crossing.</li> 

<li><strong>Ride Safely:</strong> Ride bicycles and scooters on the right side of the street, preferably in a
bike lane, or on a designated multi-use path. Always walk bikes across busy intersections and crosswalks.</li> 

<li><strong>Wear Helmets:</strong> Helmets are essential for all cyclists, including those on e-bikes and
e-scooters.</li> 

<li><strong>Walk Facing Traffic:</strong> When a sidewalk is not available, walk on the shoulder of the road
facing the oncoming traffic to see and be seen.</li> 

<li><strong>Respect Crossing Guards:</strong> Crossing guards are there for everyone’s safety–always
follow crossing guard instructions.</li> 

<li><strong>Stay Off Devices:</strong> Remind children to keep their cell phones put away and headphones
off while walking, biking, or riding.</li>
