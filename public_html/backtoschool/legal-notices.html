	  		<p>As required by the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act of 1986 (AHERA), this is the annual notification of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in certain Clark County School District (District) buildings. Asbestos is a common name given to a group of mineral fibers that occur naturally and have been incorporated into a variety of construction products, such as wall and ceiling plasters and floor tile. These materials pose no risk to health unless they are disturbed in such a way that asbestos fibers become airborne, are inhaled, and get deposited within the lungs.</p>
                                     
<p>This notice is a general notification and is not meant to give specific information about an individual location. An Asbestos Management Plan has been developed for each District location, which identifies the location, type, and amount of asbestos-containing material and describes actions taken to prevent exposure. The site-specific plan is available for review in the main office of each location during regular business hours. Copies of all plans are also kept in the Environmental Services Department office.</p>
<p>The District is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy environment for our students, staff, and visitors. For more information, visit <a href="https://environmental.ccsd.net/" target="_blank">environmental.ccsd.net</a> or call <a href="tel:(702)-799-0987">702-799-0987</a>.</p>

	  		<p>More than 60 Career and Technical Education (CTE) pathways, from agriculture science to web design, are available to Clark County School District (District) high school students. Programs are organized into the following 16 nationally recognized clusters: (1) Agriculture, Food, and Natural Resources; (2) Architecture and Construction; (3) Arts, A/V Technology, and Communication; (4) Business Management and Administration; (5) Education and Training; (6) Finance; (7) Government and Public Administration; (8) Health Science; (9) Hospitality and Tourism; (10) Human Services; (11) Information Technology; (12) Law, Public Safety, Corrections, and Security; (13) Manufacturing; (14) Marketing; (15) Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics; and (16) Transportation, Distribution, and Logistics.</p>
                                     
<p>These courses provide students with the academic and technical knowledge they need to pursue post-secondary opportunities and/or to enter the workplace upon graduation. CTE courses are available at District comprehensive high schools as well as Career and Technical Academies. The programs of study require students to complete a two-year sequence of courses. A small number of select programs may require completion of a sequence of three or four courses. Enrollment into CTE pathways is open for all high school students. CTE pathways provide hands-on training and industry relevant experiences, along with development of leadership skills through participation in career and technical student organizations.</p>

<p>The Nevada Department of Education (NDE) awards a Certificate of Skill Attainment to every CTE student who: (1) completes the CTE course sequence with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher; (2) passes a published end-of-program technical assessment; and (3) passes the Workplace Readiness assessment for employability skills. Employers in the state of Nevada may utilize this certificate for validation of a student’s knowledge and skills in the various career areas. Completing CTE pathways may contribute to the requirements for a student to qualify for a college and career readiness diploma. In addition, a number of CTE programs of study are offered as dual credit courses and/or articulate with community college courses across the state. The list of articulated CTE programs can be found on the NDE website at <a href="https://doe.nv.gov/offices/craleo/cte" target="_blank">Department of Education – Career and Technical Education</a>. The list of dual credit courses can be confirmed with each postsecondary institution. For more information about CTE courses, visit <a href="https://cteinccsd.org/" target="_blank">cteinccsd.org</a>, or speak with your student’s CTE teacher or counselor. Parents/Guardians may also refer to the school’s course registration guide.</p>

<p>The District does not discriminate against any person on the basis of race, creed/religion, color, national or ethnic origin, protective hairstyle (to include without limitation hairstyles such as natural hairstyles, afros, bantu knots, curls, braids, locks, and twists), sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, marital status or age, in admission or access to, treatment or employment in, or participation in its programs and activities, and provides equal access to the Boy Scouts of America and other designated youth groups, pursuant to federal and state laws. The District will take steps to assure that the lack of English language skills will not be a barrier to admission and participation in CTE programs.</p>

<p>Inquiries regarding compliance with Title IX issues should be directed to the Assistant Human Resources Officer, who also serves as the Title IX Coordinator for the District (not school Athletic Coordinators), at 4121 Eucalyptus Avenue, Building 5, Las Vegas, NV 89121, <a href="tel:(702)-799-5087">702-799-5087</a>, email address <a href="mailto:TitleIXCoordinators@nv.ccsd.net">TitleIXCoordinators@nv.ccsd.net</a>.

 <p>Child Find identifies students in Clark County, ages three to 21, who are not enrolled in public school and may be eligible for special education services. Qualifying criteria for evaluation of eligibility for special education services include:</p>
<ol class="review-list">
<li style="font-size:15px !important;"> Children who are not currently enrolled in a public school, where a suspicion of a disability or delay exists.</li>
<li style="font-size:15px !important;"> Children who are homeschooled, enrolled in private school, reside in hospitals, or are homeless, where a suspicion of a disability or delay exists.</li>
</ol>
 <p>Parents, guardians, or surrogates must consent to an evaluation of their child prior to an appointment with the Child Find team. A team of professionals will assess the child to determine if they are eligible for special education services under the IDEA. The team, which includes the parents or guardians, develops an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or Service Plan for each eligible student. The Child Find staff also may help families gain access to helpful community services.

	  		 <p>As a requirement under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the Clark County School District (District) has a school choice process requiring that students in unsafe schools be permitted to transfer to safer public schools. This process, known as the “Unsafe School Choice Option,” permits student transfers for two reasons:</p> 
	 <ol class="review-list">
<li style="font-size:15px !important;"> When a school is determined by the state of Nevada to be “persistently dangerous;” or</li>
<li style="font-size:15px !important;"> When a student becomes the victim of a violent crime at a school.</li>
</ol>
	 <p>If a school is identified as persistently dangerous, the District will inform parents/guardians of the designation within 10 days and offer students the option to transfer to a safe public school within 20 days. Students are allowed to transfer within 30 days. To the extent possible, the District will allow students attending a school identified as persistently dangerous to transfer to a school that has not been identified as being in need of improvement, corrective action, or restructuring. The District will take into account the needs and preferences of the affected students and parents/guardians to the extent possible. It is important to note that transportation is the responsibility of the parent(s)/guardian(s). If a student becomes the victim of a violent criminal offense at school, the student is allowed to transfer to another public school. The transfer is optional; the student is not required to transfer. This requirement does not supersede the District’s ability to discipline offenders in accordance with District regulations.</p>

	  		<p>School records of students are confidential, according to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 C.F.R. Part 99). The education records maintained by the Clark County School District (District) include a student’s academic permanent record, achievement and scholastic aptitude test results, attendance and discipline file, class record books, grade books, health inventory, and special education confidential folder (if any).</p>
 
 <p>Directory information is information not generally considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. This information is available without the consent of parents/guardians or eligible students. Directory information includes the student’s name, address, grade level, date and place of birth, photographs, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height if a member of an athletic team, dates and schools of attendance, and degrees and awards received.</p>

 <p>Photographs will be considered directory information only when used in printed school publications including the annual yearbook, playbills, honor roll or other recognition lists, graduation programs, newsletters, and sports activity programs/sheets. Parents/Guardians who do not want directory information released must file a written statement with the principal of the child’s school annually at the start of each school year.</p>

<p>In addition, two federal laws require local educational agencies to provide military recruiters, upon request, with three directory information categories – name, address, and telephone listing – unless parents/guardians have advised the school in writing that they do not want their student’s information disclosed without their prior written consent.</p>

 <p>Information other than directory information is inaccessible without the written consent of the parent/guardian or eligible student. Among those exempt from this ruling are “school officials” who have a “legitimate educational interest,” which may include the Board of School Trustees, administrators, certificated employees, classified support staff, and contractors, consultants, volunteers, and other outside parties performing outsourced institutional services or functions. Legitimate educational interest is defined as any activity having a direct effect on advancing a student’s educational level, coupled with a concern for the student’s social, emotional, and/or physical welfare.</p>

<p>To inspect education records, parents/guardians should make a written request to the principal of the child’s school to schedule a records review. The school must comply within 10 school days of the written request. The school is not required to make copies of the records unless failure to do so would effectively prevent the parent/guardian from obtaining access to the records.</p>

 <p>Parents/Guardians or eligible students may request to amend student records. The procedure to challenge records is outlined in District Regulation 5125.1, which is available online at <a href="https://ccsd.net/district/policies-regulations/pdf/5125.1_R.pdf" target="_blank">CCSD Regulation R-5125.1 (PDF)</a>, or at your child’s school.</p>

 <p>Parents/Guardians or eligible students who believe their rights have been violated may file a complaint with: Student Privacy Policy Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Ave., SW, Washington, D.C. 20202.</p>
 
<p>The confidential records of students who have been enrolled in special education are automatically destroyed during the year of the student’s 28th birthday.</p>

 <p>Upon request, the District discloses education records without consent to officials of other schools in which the student seeks or intends to enroll, or has already enrolled or transferred, if the disclosure is for purposes related to the student’s enrollment or transfer.</p>

 <p>The District has identified the following FERPA liaisons to answer related questions:</p>

	  		<p>The Clark County School District (District) participates in Nevada Medicaid’s School Health Services (SHS) program and provides school health services to children with a Plan of Care (such as an Individualized Education Program) at no cost to parents/guardians. Additionally, the District provides preventative healthcare services including crisis intervention, screenings, assessments, diagnostics, and treatment. Federal Medicaid funds are available to school districts to help recover the costs of providing these necessary services. To access these funds, the District participates in the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) Medicaid SHS program.</p>

	  <p>The Clark County School District (District) is committed to providing a safe, secure, and respectful learning environment for all students and employees at all District facilities, school buildings, on school buses, on school grounds, and at school-sponsored activities. The District strives to address discrimination based on race, bullying, and cyberbullying so that there is no disruption to the learning environment and learning process. District Policy 5137 outlines the requirements and process for ensuring safe and respectful learning environments are maintained. (Policy 5137 can be found at <a href="https://ccsd.net/" target="_blank">ccsd.net</a>, keyword search “Policy 5137” or <a href="https://ccsd.net/district/policies-regulations/pdf/5137_P.pdf" target="_blank">CCSD Policy P-5137 (PDF)</a>).</p>
	  <p>The Nevada Legislature has defined discrimination based on race, bullying, and cyberbullying. Discrimination based on race, bullying, and/or cyberbullying behaviors are prohibited. The District will comply with the reporting, notice, and investigation requirements set forth in the laws and regulations.</p>
	  <p><strong>The following reporting mechanisms are applicable to discrimination based on race, bullying, and cyberbullying.</strong></p>
	  
	  	<div class="course-overview ">
		<div class="inner-box" style="margin-bottom: -35px;">
			<p style="font-size:15px !important;">1. Students: It is the policy of the District to encourage students who are subjected to, witness, or overhear incidents of discrimination based on race, bullying, or cyberbullying to report such incidents. Students should report any incident(s) of discrimination based on race, bullying, or cyberbullying to a teacher, counselor, or school administrator. Students are also encouraged to report knowledge of discrimination based on race, bullying, or cyberbullying via SafeVoice, an anonymous reporting system, which can be accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. SafeVoice reports can be made through the hotline by calling <a href="tel:1(833)-216-7233">1-833-216-SAFE (7233)</a>, electronically at <a href="http://safevoicenv.org/" target="_blank">safevoicenv.org</a>, or through a free mobile app available in the app store for either Android or iPhone.</p>
			
<p style="font-size:15px !important;">2. Employees: Any District teacher, administrator, principal, coach, or other staff member who witnesses, overhears, or receives information about an incident of discrimination based on race, bullying, or cyberbullying at any District facility, on school grounds, in school buildings, on school buses, or at school-sponsored activities, shall report it to the principal or the principal’s designee as soon as practicable, but not later than a time during the same day on which the teacher, administrator, principal, coach, or other staff member witnesses or receives information about the incident.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<p style="font-size:15px !important;">
The District  rejects all forms of racism. The District has adopted Policy 5139 which addresses anti-racism, equity, and inclusion. This policy ensures that incidents of discrimination based on race are prohibited. The District encourages all employees, students, and parents/guardians to reflect upon and take appropriate action when they are aware of racially motivated incidents, racial discrimination, and racial aggression. The importance of this policy acknowledges the negative impact experienced by individuals, the District, and society as a result of racial discrimination and racism. The District will hold staff and students accountable and align all adult behavior to a renewed culture of high expectations for all students throughout the District and the expectation of an anti-racism culture.

        <p>The Clark County School District (District) supports a learning environment that is free from discrimination, harassment, and intimidation because of a student’s protected status in order to best promote student learning. Where a student has experienced harassment, the District will act promptly and appropriately to prevent its recurrence and correct its discriminatory effects on the complainant and others, where appropriate. Protected class groups include age, race, color, national origin, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, physical attributes, disability, and sex.</p>
<p><strong>Sexual Harassment</strong></p>
<p>The federal Title IX regulations were recently revised. The information below and supporting materials are currently being revised and will be updated.</p>
<p>The District does not discriminate on the basis of sex in its education programs or activities, and is required by Title IX not to discriminate in such a manner.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment is defined as conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following:</p>
<div class="course-overview ">
		<div class="inner-box" style="margin-bottom: -30px;">
			<p style="font-size:15px !important;">1. An employee of the District conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the District on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct (i.e., quid pro quo sexual harassment). This applies to all employees.</p>
<p style="font-size:15px !important;">2. Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to an education program or activity. This applies to all students and employees.</p>
<p style="font-size:15px !important;">3. Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, as those terms are defined under certain federal laws. (For a full definition of those terms, visit <a href="https://ccsd.net/" target="_blank">ccsd.net</a>, keyword search “Title IX,” or visit <a href="https://ccsd.net/district/info/title-ix/" target="_blank">Title IX Notice of Non-Discrimination</a>. This applies to all students and employees.</p>
		</div>
</div>
<p>Under Title IX, the District must respond when any employee or official of the District with authority to institute corrective measures has actual knowledge (sees, hears, or otherwise learns) of sexual harassment that occurred within an education program or activity. When any employee or official of the District with authority to institute corrective measures has actual knowledge of such sexual harassment, that person has a duty to report it to the District’s Assistant Human Resources Officer, who also serves as the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator (not school Athletic Coordinators) may be contacted by email at <a href="mailto:TitleIXCoordinators@nv.ccsd.net">TitleIXCoordinators@nv.ccsd.net</a>, by phone at <a href="tel:(702)-799-5087">702-799-5087</a>, or by mail at 4212 Eucalyptus Avenue, Building 5, Las Vegas, NV 89121.</p>
</p>
<p>A complainant (alleged victim) may file a formal complaint with the Assistant Human Resources Officer at the contact information above. In addition, any person may report sexual harassment to the Assistant Human Resources Officer at the contact information above.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a formal complaint or a report of sexual harassment, the Assistant Human Resources Officer will coordinate the District’s efforts to comply with its obligations under the law. The District will respond promptly and in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent, meaning not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.</p>

<p>Retaliatory behavior against any complainant or any participant in the Title IX complaint process is prohibited.</p>
<p>In addition to contacting the District Assistant Human Resources Officer, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) may also be contacted by sending a complaint or inquiry regarding Title IX to the United States Department of Education – Office for Civil Rights, 915 2nd Ave. Room 3310, Seattle, Washington 98174-1099.

<p><strong>Harassment Not Based on Sex</strong></p>

<p>For all other types of harassment that are not based on sex (i.e., not based on Title IX), harassment is defined as any verbal, visual, or physical conduct that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive that it adversely affects, or has the purpose or logical consequence of interfering with the student’s educational program or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive school atmosphere. Harassment, whether it is by students, staff, or third parties in the school community, is strictly prohibited, and will subject the perpetrator to disciplinary action. See Regulation 5141.2 which can be found at <a href="https://ccsd.net/" target="_blank">ccsd.net</a> (keyword search “Regulation 5141.2” or <a href="http://ccsd.net/district/policies-regulations/pdf/5141.2_R.pdf" target="_blank">CCSD Regulation 5141.2 (PDF)</a>). It is the principal’s responsibility to take actions as necessary to protect students and District personnel from harassment by students or staff, using the grievance complaint procedure.</p>
<p>Any student, male or female, who feels that they are a victim of harassment should immediately contact their teacher and/or principal, unless the principal or teacher is believed to be part of the harassment, in which case contact should be made with the appropriate Region Superintendent or School Associate Superintendent, Division Administrator, or the Assistant Human Resources Officer who oversees the Office of Diversity and Affirmative </p>
<p>Any student, male or female, who feels that they are a victim of harassment should immediately contact their teacher and/or principal, unless the principal or teacher is believed to be part of the harassment, in which case contact should be made with the appropriate Region Superintendent or School Associate Superintendent, Division Administrator, or the Assistant Human Resources Officer who oversees the Office of Diversity and Affirmative Action/ADA and Title IX programs, who also serves as the Title IX Coordinator for the District, by email at <a href="mailto:TitleIXCoordinators@nv.ccsd.net">TitleIXCoordinators@nv.ccsd.net</a>, by phone at <a href="tel:(702)-799-5087">702-799-5087</a>, or by mail at 4212 Eucalyptus Avenue, Building 5, Las Vegas, NV 89121.</p>

<p>Any District employee who receives a harassment complaint from a student shall immediately notify the School Principal. Any employee who observes harassing conduct shall take immediate action to stop the harassing conduct and then immediately notify the School Principal of the incident. The principal shall ensure that the complaint is promptly and appropriately investigated and will ensure that there is an opportunity to present witnesses and other evidence. If the investigation is not conducted promptly, the appropriate Region Superintendent or School Associate Superintendent, Division Administrator, or the Assistant Human Resources Officer who oversees the Office of Diversity and Affirmative Action/ADA and Title IX programs, who also serves as the Title IX Coordinator for the District, will be notified.</p>

<p>Retaliatory behavior against any complainant or any participant in the complaint process is prohibited.</p>

<p>Harassment in any form against students by either a student or a District employee is grounds for severe disciplinary action. For students, it may be the basis for suspension/expulsion in accordance with the existing disciplinary procedures. For staff, it may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. If there is a concern that the behavior constitutes bullying, it should also be reported under the bullying procedures set forth in District Policy 5137. Policy 5137 can be found at <a href="https://ccsd.net/district/policies-regulations/pdf/5137_P.pdf" target="_blank">CCSD Policy 5137 (PDF)</a>).</p>
